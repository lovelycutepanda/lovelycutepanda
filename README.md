Hi, I am @lovelycutepanda, a year 3 maths major student at CUHK who is a beginner in computer science.

I have learnt basic web development using HTML, css and javascript (React.js) while working on a game project. You may try it out through this link (although it is not completed yet):
https://csci3100-game.herokuapp.com/

I also have experience in different programming languages, including Python, C, C++, Matlab, Pascal. I have been training myself through leetcode problems, in order that I can come up with better solutions. When I have more free time, I would like to challenge myself with different projects.
