Hi, I am @lovelycutepanda, a year 4 maths major student at CUHK who is interested in computer science.

I have learnt basic web development using HTML, css and javascript (React) while working on a game project. You may try it out through this link:

During my third university summer holiday, I took up an internship job and had been an IT programmer trainee in a start-up company. During my internship, I have worked with fellow students from different universities to build up a company website using WordPress. It is not as hard as building website through manually coding, but I have understood more about the importance of maintainability for a project, such as hosting service management, stability of server, clear documentation, expenses, etc.

I am currently working on another web development project, where I can practise using MERN (MongoDB + Express + React + Node.js) to build a web application. 

I have some experience in different programming languages, including C++, javascript, Python, C, Matlab. I have been training myself through leetcode problems, in order that I can write better codes. In particular, I have understood more about data structures and algorithms, including their typical uses, pros and cons in different situations taking time and space into considerations, to name but a few.

When I have more free time, I would like to challenge myself with different projects.
